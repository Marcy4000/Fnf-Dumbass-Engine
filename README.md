**DISCLAIMER:** Not all code was written by me, since most of the basic engine stuff (note inputs, chart loading, pause menu ecc.) was forked from [Unity Party](https://github.com/Shattered-Devs/Unity-Party), which is a much better (In my opinion) Fnf engine made in unity and you should go check it out too.

# Fnf-Mavcy-Engine
Ever wanted to enjoy a simple game of Friday Night Funkin but psych engine is too good and well done for you? Well i've got the solution for you: this thing!
## Stuff i added to this engine
### Mod Support
Incredible right? You can add custom songs, stages, weeks and characters all from a single folder. Included in the engine there are a Badly desinged Level editor and a buggy Character creator to help you create mods. Wait what do you mean by "Psych engine has this too"?.
### Cutscene Support
You can play custom mp4 videos before any song, and add dialogue with my totally 100% working and intuitive dialogue system.
### Options Menu
Yeah that's it, it's just an options menu.
### Mobile Build
Yes, there is a Mobile Build for this thing, just need to figure out how to publish it.
## How to build and stuff
You need to download [Unity 2020.23 or newer](https://unity.com/download) to open the project, and the IDE of your choise (personally use [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/it/) 2022), then just open the project and build.

### Notes for anyone wanting to modify the source code
I'm sorry for anyone that will look at the source code, also called my "Fine spaghetti". It's filled with Bad file names, no comments and old scripts with even worse names.
